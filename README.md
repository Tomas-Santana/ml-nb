# Machine Learning Notebook
Compilation of projects from MSCS 335 - Machine Learning at the University of Wisconsin - Stout.

Each project has its own directory with the files necesary to run it. Most datasets are not included in the repository, but links to them are provided in the README files. Some of the notebook entries have not been cleaned up, but they are still functional.

## 5. Decision Trees and Random Forest Classification

Link to the entry: [src/5_decision_trees_random_forest](src/5_decision_trees_random_forest)

For this project we implemented Decision Trees for classification of the [Obesity Levels dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatemehmehrparvar/obesity-levels). We also compared the performance of Random Forest and SVC classifiers. We used the [Magic Gamma Telescope dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/159/magic+gamma+telescope) from UCI ML repository. Finally we implemented a simple Gini impurity calculator.
