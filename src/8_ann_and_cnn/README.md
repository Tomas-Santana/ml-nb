# Notebook Check 8. ANN and CNN

In this assignment, we used a simple ANN and CNN on the EMNIST Dataset (url: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning) to classify written letters.

In the `emnist_draw_classifier.py` file, you can draw a letter and the model will predict the letter. The model is trained on the EMNIST dataset, which contains handwritten letters.
