# Notebook Check 6. Bagging Classifiers and Random Forest Classifiers

In this assignments, we used a bagging classifier with a linear SVC and a random forest classifier on the Fashion MNIST Dataset (url: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist).

We also visualized the feature importances of the random forest classifier (`random_forest_importance.py`).
